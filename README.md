# Digital-Phase-Locked-Loop-PLL
Single Phase Digital PLL design using TI's Delfino Launchpad

In power applications, we often require a PLL to lock the grid frequency to be used for control applications. This article details the design of Single Phase PLL based on TI's Application Note: http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sprabt3/sprabt3.pdf
